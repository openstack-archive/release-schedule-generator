      R-18:
        - mitaka-1: >
            Dec 1-3 is the mitaka-1 milestone window for projects following the
            release:cycle-with-milestones model.
      R-11:
        - mitaka-2: >
            Jan 19-21 is the mitaka-2 milestone window for projects following
            the release:cycle-with-milestones model.
      R-5:
        - mitaka-3: >
            Libraries that are not client libraries (Oslo and others) should
            issue their final release during this week. That allows to give
            time for last-minute changes before feature freeze.
        - Feature freeze: >
            The mitaka-3 milestone marks feature freeze for projects following
            the release:cycle-with-milestones model. No featureful patch should
            be landed after this point. Exceptions may be granted by the
            project PTL.
        - Final release for client libraries: >
            Client libraries should issue their final release during this week,
            to match feature freeze.
        - Soft StringFreeze: >
            You are no longer allowed to accept proposed changes containing
            modifications in user-facing strings. Such changes should be
            rejected by the review team and postponed until the next series
            development opens (which should happen when RC1 is published).
      R-3:
        - RC1 target week: >
            The week of March 14-18 is the target date for projects following
            the release:cycle-with-milestones model to issue their first
            release candidate.
        - Hard StringFreeze: >
            This happens when the RC1 for the project is tagged. At this point,
            ideally no strings are changed (or added, or removed), to give
            translator time to finish up their efforts.
      R-1:
        - Final RCs and intermediary releases: >
            The week of March 28 to April 1st is the last week to issue release
            candidates or intermediary releases before release week. On release
            week only final-release-critical releases will be accepted (at the
            discretion of the release team).
      R-0:
        - Mitaka release: >
            The Mitaka coordinated release will happen on April 7th.

        - newton-1 milestone: >
            May 31 - June 2 is the newton-1 milestone window for projects

            the release:cycle-with-milestones model.
      R-6:
        - Final release for non-client libraries: >
            Libraries that are not client libraries (Oslo and others) should
            issue their final release during this week. That allows to give
            time for last-minute changes before feature freeze.

            August 30 - Sept 1 is the newton-3 milestone window for projects
            following the release:cycle-with-milestones model.
        - Feature freeze: >
            The newton-3 milestone marks feature freeze for projects following
            the release:cycle-with-milestones model. No featureful patch should
            be landed after this point. Exceptions may be granted by the
            project PTL.
        - Final release for client libraries: >
            Client libraries should issue their final release during this week,
            to match feature freeze.
        - Soft StringFreeze: >
            You are no longer allowed to accept proposed changes containing
            modifications in user-facing strings. Such changes should be
            rejected by the review team and postponed until the next series
            development opens (which should happen when RC1 is published).
        - Requirements freeze: >
            After the newton-3 milestone, only critical requirements and
            constraints changes will be allowed. Freezing our requirements list
            gives packagers downstream an opportunity to catch up and prepare
            packages for everything necessary for distributions of the upcoming
            release. The requirements remain frozen until the stable branches
            are created, with the release candidates.
